    "### You're a Data Scientist!\n",
    "You are working as a Junior Data Scientist for a professional football (er, Soccer) club.  The owner of the team is very interested in seeing how the use of data can help improve the team's peformance, and perhaps win them a championship!\n",
    "\n",
    "The draft is coming up soon (thats when you get to pick new players for your team), and the owner has asked you to create a model to help score potential draftees.  The model should look at attributes about the player and predict what their \"rating\" will be once they start playing professionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The football club's data team has provided you with data for 17,993 footballers from the league.  Your job: work with the Senior Data Scientist to build a model or models, perform model selection, and make predictions on players you have not yet seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is stored in a csv file called `footballer_data.csv`.  The data contain 52 columns, including some information about the player, their skills, and their overall measure as an effective footballer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most features relate to the player's abilities in football related skills, such as passing, shooting, dribbling, etc.  Some features are rated on a 1-5 scale (5 being the best), others are rated on 0-100 (100 being the best), and others still are categorical (e.g. work rate is coded as low, medium, or high).\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable (or $y$ variable) is `overall`.  This is an overall measure of the footballer's skill and is rated from 0 to 100.  The most amazingly skilled footballer would be rated 100, where as I would struggle to score more than a 20. The model(s) you build should use the other features to predict `overall`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Follow These Steps before submitting\n",
    "Once you are finished, ensure to complete the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Restart your kernel by clicking 'Kernel' > 'Restart & Run All'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Fix any errors which result from this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Repeat steps 1. and 2. until your notebook runs without errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Submit your completed notebook to OWL by the deadline.\n",

Not all of the other columns are particularly useful for modelling though (for instance, `ID` is just a unique identifier for the player.  This is essentially an arbitrary number and has no bearing on the player's rating).\n",

Before we begin modelling, it is important to obtain a baseline for the accuracy of our predictive models. Compute the absolute errors on the original data that result if we use the median of the `overall` variable to make predictions. This will serve as our baseline performance. Plot the distribution of the losses (absolute errors) and print their mean and standard deviation."
